### Projects

1. [Rock Paper Scissors](https://gitpod.io#snapshot/3854204e-375e-483b-9cf0-017a14c75be8)
    - developed rock paper scissor bot by implementing a single markov chain, competed against 4 different computer and won at least 60% of the games in each match (out of 1000 matches each)
2. [Cat and Dog Image Classifier](https://github.com/syedgggg/syedgggg.github.io/blob/master/assets/projects/FCCML/2_fcc_cat_dog_updated.ipynb)
   - using TensorFlow, from scratch, built a neural network which classified images as either cats or dogs successfully with above 74% accuracy (needed: 63% accuracy to pass)
3. [Book Recommendation Engine using KNN](https://github.com/syedgggg/syedgggg.github.io/blob/master/assets/projects/FCCML/3_fcc_book_recommendation_knn.ipynb)
   - using scikit-learn to create a recommendation engine which returns 5 book suggestions based on a book suggestion from user
4. [Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator](https://github.com/syedgggg/syedgggg.github.io/blob/master/assets/projects/FCCML/4_fcc_predict_health_costs_with_regression.ipynb)
   - using TensorFlow to predict health care costs, built a neural network achieving mean absolute error under $3500 (metric needed to beat to pass)
5. [Neural Network SMS Text Classifier](https://github.com/syedgggg/syedgggg.github.io/blob/master/assets/projects/FCCML/5_fcc_sms_text_classification_updated.ipynb)
   - using Tensorflow, from scratch, built a neural network which classified text as either spam or not by up to 97% accuracy (on the validation test set)
